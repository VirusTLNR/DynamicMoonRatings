## Changelog

### 1.0.2
- Fixed an issue where a black screen would occur on game load when you had non-standard company moons (ie, more than Gordion) installed (for example, Oxyde or Galetry). these will now have their original ratings shown, unless you use custom ratings.
- Fixed an issue where custom ratings didnt show correctly after loading the game and using the terminal for the first time.

### 1.0.1
- Fixed an issue with A### display mode
- Fixed a few ratings logging issues where the correct information was not logged properly
- Fixed custom moon ratings to be set and updated correctly (you must load a game save once before you can config custom moon ratings! Tiers can be set at any time but may require a game save load if you want more/less tiers)

### 1.0.0
- Initial Release - See readme for details on features
